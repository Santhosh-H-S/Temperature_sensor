# Temperature Sensor
Components used : n-MOSFET (IRF 3205), NTC thermsitor (5k ohm), LED, connecting wires, breadboard, resistors, DC supply.

A simple voltage divider circuit is used to set up a temperature sensor where one of the resistors is replaced by the thermistor.
The DC supply is given to the drain terminal in series with limiting resistor and an LED. Increase in temperature is sensed by 
the thermistor making the LED glow.
